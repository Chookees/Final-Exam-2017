# Final-Exam-2017
This is my Final Exam, i passed it with 96% correct. The Task was to Create an Enviroment where you could add sportsman and read their times in running, swimming, and cycling, also we had to make out a final winner in those categories and to change time in minutes or hours because in the Database it was in seconds.

The Program is complete in german, since i live here and it was for my Teacher.
